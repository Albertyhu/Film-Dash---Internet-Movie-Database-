How you choose which database you want to work with: 

The following code is how you connect with MongoDB with Mongoose:
const mongoose = require('mongoose')
const mongoDB = `mongodb+srv://${process.env.USER}:${process.env.PASS}@locallibrarycluster.lyfvtsg.mongodb.net/MovieRental?retryWrites=true&w=majority`
mongoose.connect(mongoDB, options)

If focus on this part of the mongoDB object, you will notice where the database name goes.
.mongodb.net/MovieRental?retryWrites=true&w=majority`

How models are named and created: 
After you define the models and connect with MongoDB database with mongoose, you will make the name all lower case letters and make it plural

module.exports = mongoose.model('Actor', ActorSchema)

This will create the collection 'actors' in the database.

I ran into issues of not being able to connect with MongoDB database.
I resolved the issue by creating a new user and password in MongoDB and writing the following line in app.js
require("dotenv").config();

Make sure to give the new user account the privilege to read and write any database.

How to use faker: 

const faker = require('faker');

const randomStatus = faker.random.arrayElement(["Available", "Maintenance", "Loaned", "Reserved"]);
const randomDate = faker.date.between('2020-01-01', '2022-01-01');

const exampleInstance = await MovieInstance.create({
  movie: exampleMovie._id,
  status: randomStatus,
  dateAvailable: randomDate,
});
